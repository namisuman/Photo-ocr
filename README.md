#------------------- read this to run the software------------------ 
#To run the OCR you need have octave installed on your system 
#Then you need to open the octave CLI and execute the following instructions:
# 1.Go to the folder containing the codes by using cd command 
# 2.Type "textDetection"(without quotes) 
# 3.Type the name of the image with path eg. E:/ABC/Image.png
# 4.The characters predicted are the results.(you get good results in case image has single line text but characters are 
#predicted in random order in case of multiple lines so project can work good to read single text images as number plates)
